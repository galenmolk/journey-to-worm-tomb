INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 
CHRISTOPHER PRINCE (18; a preppy and studious intellect) JUMPS in a panic, from his tattered twin size bed when the sounds of GUN SHOTS blare through his bedroom window. 
NEIGHBOR (O.S.) 
Come on yo, it’s too early in da 
mornin fa dis fuckin shit. 
His heart POUNDS, he wipes the crust from his eyes and rests his face in his hands. Aggravated, Christopher drops his head back on the pillow. He exhales deep and stares at the filthy pop corn ceiling. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thank you God, for getting me out 
of this place. 
His thoughts are interrupted by Christopher’s little brother, JOSHUA PRINCE (6; undeniably adorable and needy). Joshua stands at the end of the bed, he grabs Christopher’s toes. Christopher picks his brother up and holds him tight. 
JOSHUA 
The fire crackers woke me up again. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m sorry, Joshua. 
JOSHUA 
(rubs his eyes) 
I’m hungry. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Guess what? I’m hungry too. 
Christopher grabs Joshua, throws him on the bed. He tickles Joshua while they both laugh hysterical. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I’m going to eat you for breakfast. 
Christopher hugs Joshua tight and looks him in the eyes. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Do you know what today is? 
Joshua drops his head unable to make eye contact. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
You’re going to be a big boy for 
Aunt Nancy until I get back right?
2. 
2.
JOSHUA 
Can I go with you? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Not this time, Buddy. I promise you 
once I get settled, I’m coming 
right back for you. 
JOSHUA 
Is Mommy going to be there? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(doleful) 
No, she will not. Remember we spoke 
about this? It’s just us. Do you 
understand what I’m saying? 
Joshua nods. Christopher points to Joshua’s chest. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
And Mommy will be right here. 
Always and forever... 
The two perform their brotherly handshake. YOU...ME...WE. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Let’s get you some food. 
Christopher gets up from the bed and stretches, he grabs a towel from a nearby chair and wraps it around his neck when-- a roach crawls across his chest. Christopher freaks out; he swipes the roach and wiggles his body. Joshua laughs loud. 
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The pair walk down the hall when another set of CHILDREN run by them. They reach the kitchen where AUNT NANCY (40; a money hungry foster guardian) irons clothes and talks on the phone. 
AUNT NANCY 
Good mornin’ to you too. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(rolls his eyes) 
Jesus, would you give us a chance 
to get in the kitchen? 
Aunt Nancy SLAMS the iron down, she glares at Christopher. 
AUNT NANCY 
Whatchu jus said ta me? 
3. 
3.
CHRISTOPHER 
(backs down) 
Good Morning, Aunt Nancy. 
AUNT NANCY 
Don’t get all high and mighty again 
cuz you leavin fa college today. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I said good morning, Aunty. 
Aunt Nancy points the steaming iron toward Christopher. 
AUNT NANCY 
Don’t Forget who took care of your 
ass these past years. 
(on the phone) 
Just like his damn mother. Anyway, 
what time you gonna be ready? I 
gotta get away from all dese kids. 
Christopher walks to the cupboard. He grabs Joshua’s bottles of prescriptions; pours the pills into his hands. He grabs a cup and fills it with tap water from the kitchen sink. 
Christopher passes Joshua his meds and the water. Joshua swallows all of the contents and smiles wide with pride. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Great job, Josh. 
Christopher grabs two bowls from the cupboard and a box of cereal from the top of the fridge. He pours cereal in the bowls, goes back to the fridge, grabs the milk. 
He empties the milk into Joshua’s bowl- there’s barely enough for a sufficient bowl of cereal. Christopher shakes his head frustrated. Sadness clouds Joshua’s face. 
JOSHUA 
We can share. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s fine, you need all of this 
food for those big muscles. Let me 
see how big they are? 
Joshua flexes his arm. Christopher’s eyes widen he leans in. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Man! I need to start going to your 
gym class. 
Joshua eats his food. Christopher walks toward the bathroom. 
4. 
4.
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 
Christopher bumps into his cousin, Yasir (late teens; bully) who also walks to the bathroom. They race for the door. On impact, Yasir falls back. Christopher rushes in to the bathroom. Yasir pushes the door from the other side. 
YASIR (O.S.) 
I needa go, Chris! 
So do I. 
CHRISTOPHER YASIR (O.S.) 
Yo, Imma dead ass punch you, if you 
make me late for school. 
Yasir kicks on the door hard. BOOM. BOOM. Christopher turns on the water, shakes out his towel and undresses. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’ll be quick. I swear. 
Christopher jumps in the shower and SCREAMS. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
AH! What happened to the hot water? 
YASIR (O.S.) 
(laughing) 
Fa someone goin to college you damn 
sure don’t know how to read. 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.) 
Stop screamin in my damn house! 
INT. PROJECT ELEVATOR - DAY 
Christopher dressed in a black shabby suit, pushes the shopping cart of white trash bags filled with his belongings on to the elevator pervaded with puddles of urine. 
Why?! 
CHRISTOPHER 
He tucks his nose in his shirt and looks up; the sign taped to the wall: NOTICE - NO HOT WATER, AUGUST 23, 7AM-7PM. 
The sign is tampered with: WHAT’S UP BABY, TAKE ME OUT TO DINNER and SHUT UP BITCH, hand written in red marker. 
5. 
5.
EXT. PROJECTS - DAY 
Christopher exits the project building, passes the piles of garbage on the floor. He drops his head, nervous while he walks by TRAE (20’s; the block’s biggest drug dealer, cocky) surrounded by his CREW. Trae glares at Christopher. 
TRAE 
You a lil overdressed for da 
laundromat, Einstein. 
CHRISTOPHER 
All clean clothes in here. 
TRAE 
You movin out? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Yes I am, heading to school. 
TRAE 
I was startin to like you, Carlton. 
Christopher chuckles. He looks around anxious for his ride. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
See you around. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Unfortunately, I won’t be coming 
back. Ever. 
TRAE 
You goin to college, Einstein, dat 
debt you bout to come out wit, 
projects goin’ be da only thing you 
can afford. I’ll be seein’ you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(under his breath) 
Not a chance in hell, I’m coming 
back to this place. 
EXT. PROJECTS - DAY 
Trae’s soldiers drag Balid (30’s; junkie, bullet wound in his leg) toward Trae. Trae rubs his hands together, eyes slant. 
TRAE 
Yea. Bring dat nigga over here. 
BALID 
I’m sorry, I 
6. 
6.
POW. Balid is knocked across his head with Trae’s gun. Trae’s soldiers gather around, they all trample his body on the floor. Balid’s blood pours over the concrete while his face is smashed into the pavement. 
Christopher stands immobile; eyes wide, fear stricken. Balid’s cries echo throughout the projects. Christopher clenches the shopping cart tight. Trae looks on, hysterical. 
TRAE 
Aight, dats enough. 
Trae’s soldier grabs Balid and throws him in a pile of garbage. Balid’s face glistens with blood and sweat. 
Christopher trembles at the gruesome sight. Unaware of the black, gleaming Mercedes that pulled up in front of him. 
EXT. PROJECTS - DAY 
MATTHEW WHARTON (18; Caucasian, Christopher’s childhood friend, who desperately wants to be seen) steps out; eyes wide, mouth floored. He twirls around fascinated by the facade of the project buildings. 
MATTHEW 
Wow, so this is the hood? I feel 
like Neno Brown just standing here. 
Christopher cowers, he snaps out of the horrific trans and rushes toward Matthew, with haste. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Matthew, hey. We have to hurry 
MATTHEW 
Look at the buildings, do you think 
they have trap houses? 
Trae looks over and walks toward the pair. 
TRAE 
Whatchu tryna cop, Elvis? 
MATTHEW 
No, I’m not a Police Officer 
CHRISTOPHER 
This is my friend, Matthew, he’s 
driving me to school. 
Matthew waves his hand, he smiles wide, full of joy. 
7. 
7.
MATTHEW 
Pleasure to meet you. 
TRAE 
Why ya’ll niggas feel like da only 
way out da hood is school? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(nervous chuckle) 
You should apply. School could be 
YOUR way out of here. 
TRAE 
Nigga, I don’t live here. Every 
night I go to my palatial condo and 
get my dick sucked while eatin 
Tiramisu and all dat other fancy 
shit wit silent letters. 
Trae pulls out a knot of money from his pockets. Christopher and Matthew look on mesmerized; their eyes sparkle. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
I get mines tax free and witout dat 
frail ass piece of paper. Why work 
hard when you can work smart? 
An all black matte Range Rover with dark tints pulls behind Matthew’s car. The windows roll down partially exposing another MAN in the backseat. Christoper gets a quick glance. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
Have fun in school, Einstein. Lemme 
know when you ready ta make some 
real money. And get dis car outta 
here, you makin my block hot. 
Trae walks toward the truck; climbs in and speeds off. 
EXT. PROJECTS - DAY 
Trae’s soldiers scatter, exposing Balid; spread across the garbage. Matthew shrinks back, caught off guard. 
MATTHEW 
Whoa! What is that? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Typical Monday. 
Christopher shoves his clothes in the trunk. 
8.
8. 
MATTHEW 
What happens on Tuesday? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Those guys don’t get a Tuesday. 
EXT. PROJECTS - DAY 
JASMINE GENY (18; brazen and witty, Christopher’s friend since he moved to Brooklyn) walks out of the building towards her Uber with a large suitcase in hand. Matthew stares; his eyebrows waggled. 
MATTHEW 
Sheesh, who is that? 
CHRISTOPHER 
That’s my friend, Jasmine. 
MATTHEW 
Hook a nigga up? 
What?! 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
My bad, I didn’t mean it like that. 
Don’t get all February on me. 
Christopher looks around terrified. He jumps in Matthew’s face and whispers in an angry and fearful tone. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Surviving Brooklyn for five minutes 
does not grant you a black card. 
MATTHEW 
Ok, Bro. Relax... Hook a Cracker 
up. Better? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Getting there. 
They both stare at Jasmine in awe as she heads toward them. 
MATTHEW 
Oh, I see what’s happening? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(blushes) 
No, no, no. Jasmine has been heaven 
sent since I arrived in Brooklyn. 
(MORE) 
(MORE)

CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
She’s just a really good friend of 
mine. One of a kind. 
MATTHEW 
Ok, I’m a little jealous. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You don’t know how to be anything 
else, Matt. 
Matthew nudges Christopher and laughs. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Jasmine, this is my friend Matthew. 
She’s going to be attending Casturn 
University with us. 
MATTHEW 
Music to my ears. I can’t wait to 
get more acquainted with you. Would 
you like me to carry that to your 
Uber, Beautiful? 
JASMINE 
No, thank you. 
(To Christopher) 
Where are you going dressed like 
that? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I told you I have an interview. 
JASMINE 
With who? The Men in Black? 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s the only thing I could find at 
the dusty thrift store. 
Jasmines stares him down. She fixes his top button. 
JASMINE 
Good luck, remember to only shoot 
the little girl. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Call me when you get to campus. 
JASMINE 
(To Matthew) 
See you later, Bieber. 
10. 
10.
MATTHEW 
The pleasure was all mine and feel 
free to call me whatever you want. 
I will. 
JASMINE 
Jasmine climbs into the Uber and speeds off. 
INT. MATTHEW’S LAVISH CAR - DAY 
Matthew and Christopher climb into the car. 
MATTHEW 
College is going to be so fun, 
we’re back together, Bro. We are 
going to fuck all the bad bitches. 
Matthew pulls off. Christopher looks out the passenger side window, lost in his thoughts he tunes out Matthew. 
MONTAGE OF BROOKLYN: 
Project buildings flooded with drug dealers. Abandoned buildings. Drug addicts on the side walks. Homeless people beg for money. 
INT. MATTHEW’S CAR - DAY 
Matthew drives through the streets slow, he takes in the atmosphere of “the ghetto” and shakes his head. 
MATTHEW 
No offense, but I don’t know how 
anyone could live like this. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Some people don’t have the luxury 
of choice. 
MATTHEW 
I know you’re happy to be coming 
home. I sure am. 
CHRISTOPHER 
That’s an understatement. I felt 
like I was in a war zone. 
MATTHEW 
I thought gentrification was 
suppose to change things. 
11. 
11.
CHRISTOPHER 
Path-mark to Whole Foods. 
MATTHEW 
Is Brooklyn really as bad as they 
make it seem on the news? 
Worse. 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
Bro, on my drive over here. I saw a big ass rat. 
Just one? 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
There’s no way you couldn’t tell me 
he wasn’t, Master Splinter. It was 
huge. He was walking on two feet 
and everything. 
MONTAGE OF LONG ISLAND: 
They drive through Long Island; the essence is much more cleaner, affluent, lavish. Big houses filled with acres of land. Caucasian children step off the school buses. The side walks clean and packed with expensive cars. 
EXT./INT. MATTHEW'S CAR/CASTBURN CAMPUS - DAY 
Christopher steps out of the car on to the crowded campus. He twirls around; glares at the buildings with pride, his smile stretches across his face. He closes his eyes and breathes deep while he soaks in the sun that gleams on his skin. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It feels so good to be back. 
MATTHEW 
We are not at the beach, Chris. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(chuckles) 
Thanks for the ride, Matt. 
MATTHEW 
No problem, I’ll get your stuff to 
the dorm. You don’t have any 
roaches crawling around in here? 
12. 
12.
CHRISTOPHER 
I hope not. 
MATTHEW 
I’m joking. 
I’m not. 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher walks toward the desk to CARALEIGH (a promiscuous senior) signing people in. She gives him a come-hither look, her cleavage seeps out of her low cut V-neck shirt. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Hey, I’m Christopher Prince. 
CARALEIGH 
You’re Ms. Rachel’s son, right? I 
just finished an internship with 
your mother’s old firm. So sorry 
for your loss. I’m here if you ever 
want to talk. 
Thanks. 
CHRISTOPHER CARALEIGH 
I have your name right here, but it 
looks like you have to report to 
the Bursar’s office. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Ok. Thank you. 
CARALEIGH 
I hope to see you soon. 
She grabs Christopher’s hand and bats her eyes. He exits. 
INT. BURSAR’S OFFICE - DAY 
Christopher walks into the Bursar’s office toward WANDA (Office Assistant, amiable) at the window. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Good morning, my name is 
Christopher Prince, I was told I 
had to report to this office. 
13. 
13.
WANDA 
Hello Christopher, let’s see what 
we have here. 
Wanda types away on her computer. 
WANDA (CONT'D) 
It looks like you have a balance of 
$25,000 due. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(chokes) 
I’m sorry? 
WANDA 
It says it right here you have a 
balance of $25,000 due. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m sorry, Ma’am I think there may 
be a system error, my trust fund is 
covering my tuition expenses. 
WANDA 
We haven’t received any form of 
payment, Hun. 
CHRISTOPHER 
How is that possible? 
WANDA 
The one and only payment I have 
received is your Shine Bright Chess 
scholarship. 
Christopher drops his head on the counter and breathes deep. 
WANDA (CONT'D) 
You may want to speak with your 
current guardian. If your expenses 
are being withdrawn from your trust 
it shouldn’t take long for the 
payment to process. 
Wanda places her hand over Christopher’s and passes him a business card. 
WANDA (CONT'D) 
I’ll put your account on hold in 
the interim. Don’t worry, you have 
a month to complete your payment 
that’s plenty of time to get your 
situation settled. 
Thank you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
14. 14.
He takes the card and exits with fire in his eyes. He pulls out his phone and dials, Aunt Nancy. The phone goes straight to voicemail. Christopher hangs up and sends a text. 
CHRISTOPHER (TEXT) (CONT'D) 
Call me back please, my school 
didn’t receive the payment for my 
tuition, it’s an emergency. 
Christopher hangs up his phone and bangs it on his head. 
INT. COMPUTER LAB - DAY 
Christopher sits at the computer with his pen and note pad; he types in to the Google search bar: “Quick Scholarships for College”. A list of 300 Scholarships and deadlines pop up. 
Christopher prints the page and works from the top; he crosses off all the Scholarships listed with deadlines that have passed, only a quarter of the list is left. 
Christopher searches through the website of the first scholarship listed he fills out the application, clicks apply, and anxiously waits for the verdict- DENIED. 
Christopher crosses off different scholarships listed on his page. He applies for another- DENIED. Christopher’s list gets smaller and smaller. DENIED. DENIED. DENIED, DENIED. DENIED. 
Christopher applies to another, he bites his nails, while he waits: “Thank you for submitting your application to the Line Hort Scholarship program, please allow us 8-10 weeks to review your application”. 
Christopher SLAMS his fist on the key board. He crosses off the last Scholarship on his list. He rest his head in his palm. His phone vibrates: 
MATTHEW (TEXT) 
Where are you? I thought you wanted 
me to drive you to your interview? 
Christopher jumps out of his seat, he grabs his things and runs for the exit with haste. 
15. 
15.
INT. VISTA BANK - OFFICE - LATER 
Christopher sits at the desk across from his interviewer, DONALD HILDEBRAND (40’s; President of Vista Bank, immature as if he’s having a mid-life crisis). 
DONALD 
Young man, your resume is 
impressive. Impeccable references 
and my personal favorite, Captain 
of the Chess team, you’ll have to 
teach me how to play someday. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Chess is very much like the game of 
life, all about who you surround 
yourself with. Mr. Hildebrand, I am 
someone you want to have on your 
side of the board. 
DONALD 
(grins) 
You have your Mother’s spirit in 
you, I like that. She was a 
powerhouse. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Please do not make the mistake of 
expecting anything less from me. 
DONALD 
I want you to report here at 3:45 
PM tomorrow. 
Christopher’s smile fills his face. He shakes Donald’s hand hard with excitement. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Will do. Sir, Thank you so much. 
DONALD 
Anytime. I’ll have my Assistant 
send you the paperwork, we’ll start 
you at nineteen dollars an hour. 
CHRISTOPHER 
The job post mentioned paying a 
percentage of tuition in addition 
to hourly pay? 
DONALD 
Yes, after you’ve completed three 
months, the company will pay for up 
to 3% of your Spring semester. 
16. 
16.
Christopher’s smile fades, he tries his best to cover his disappointment. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thanks so much, Mr. Hildebrand. I 
appreciate the opportunity. 
DONALD 
Call me, Donnie. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Donnie, I’ll see you tomorrow, 3:45 
sharp. Thank you again. 
INT. MATTHEW’S CAR - DAY 
Christopher climbs into Matthew’s car. 
MATTHEW 
How did it go? 
Christopher shrugs his shoulders and looks down desolated. 
I got it. 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
Don’t look so excited, you’ve only 
beat 2,400 other applicants that 
applied for the position. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Because he knew my mom. 
MATTHEW 
It’s all about who you know. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It only pays up to 3% of the next 
semester. I need 25,000 dollars 
like yesterday and my Aunt isn’t 
answering any of my calls. 
A notification flashes across Christopher’s phone: “Give Joshua his meds”. Christopher huffs. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
May I borrow your phone? 
Matthew hands Christopher his phone. Christopher dials Aunt Nancy’s number. The phone rings for half a second. 
Hello? 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.) CHRISTOPHER 
17. 17.
Aunt Nancy, It’s me, Christopher. 
Did Joshua take his meds? 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.) 
Yes. Whatchu want? I’m busy. 
CHRISTOPHER 
My school never received my tuition 
payment. I called the attorney he 
said my trust was exhausted. 
AUNT NANCY 
Ok?! I ain’t got no money. So you 
called the wrong one. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Aunt Nancy, I need that money to 
pay for my tuition. 
AUNT NANCY 
You a smart boy, go get you one of 
dem scholarship things. 
Christopher’s body tenses up; he closes his eyes, breathes deep. Unable to hold back, his fist clench, the anger bursts. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What happened to all my funds?! 
AUNT NANCY 
Watch ya damn tone! You think da 
roof ova ya head and food you eat 
is free? I took care of you dese 
past few 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’ve only been with you for two 
years, how could you have possibly 
spent all my money. 
AUNT NANCY 
I don’t have time fa dis shit, 
figure it da fuck out like I had to 
CHRISTOPHER 
I want my money! 
It’s gone! 
AUNT NANCY 
18. 
18.
Aunt Nancy hangs up the phone. Christopher hands Matthew his phone. He rests his head; he can’t fight the tears that fall. Matthew sits in silence, he passes Christopher a tissue. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know what I’m going to do. 
MATTHEW 
We’ll figure something out. I’ve 
got your back. Whatever you need. 
INT. MATTHEW'S CAR - DAY 
Christopher sits motionless while his eyes stay glued to the Man he saw earlier in the truck, Big C (40’s; a react first menace). Big C exits the bank and climbs into the same SUV. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Follow that car. 
What? 
MATTHEW 
CHRISTOPHER 
Hurry up, follow the car! 
Ok, ok. 
MATTHEW 
Matthew speeds off and tries to catch up to the Black SUV. They drive down the streets and tag along the car. Matthew stays two cars behind and swerves when another SUV jumps in front of him. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Shit, I can’t see them now. 
Christopher looks on eager, the SUV turns into the right lane and makes an exit. 
CHRISTOPHER 
They’re right there, hurry up, take 
the exit. 
Matthew switches lanes, cuts off the car beside him and almost causes an accident. He merges on to the exit. His car screeches from the speed while he tries to catch up. 
The SUV drives down the street and makes a left turn into an alley. Big C steps out of the car. Hurried, Matthew turns into the alley. 
19. 
19.
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
No! Don’t turn, don’t turn! 
MATTHEW 
What the hell? 
Matthew turns in the opposite direction, his car screeches, rolls off the curb and jumps off the side walk. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Drive, drive! 
Matthew pushes hard on the gas, his heart races. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Shit, do you think they noticed? 
MATTHEW 
A white boy driving a Mercedes. We 
blended well. 
CHRISTOPHER 
We’re going to die. We’re going to 
die, Matt. 
MATTHEW 
We’re not going to die. 
Matthew parks his car on the corner of a coffee shop located in Queens; he steps out, checks around for damage. 
EXT. MATTHEW’S CAR 
Christopher steps out of the car and takes deep breaths. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You don’t understand who that is. 
MATTHEW 
It better be the next President, 
the way he has you shitting in your 
pants right now. 
El Cafe. Who? 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
CHRISTOPHER 
El Cafe! He’s one of, correction, the only biggest drug King Pin in New York. 
20. 
20.
MATTHEW 
What kind of suicide squad mission 
did you have me on? Why were we 
following that man? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know. I had this feeling. 
MATTHEW 
Are you crazy? I may not be street 
smart but even I know you don’t go 
around following drug dealers. 
King Pin! 
CHRISTOPHER 
Matthew bangs his hand on the car. 
MATTHEW 
We are definitely going to die. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I said that. 
Matthew walks off toward the coffee shop. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Where are you going? 
MATTHEW 
To get some Cafe. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Right now?! 
MATTHEW 
(mocking) 
I have this feeling. 
Christopher sits down; pushes his hands against his face. He looks up and is instantly punched in the face by DONIR (40’s; Big C’s, oversized body guard). Christopher falls back into the car, he hits his head on the steering wheel. 
He is dragged out and thrown into a black SUV. A black bag is forced over his head and the SUV speeds off. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The bag is ripped from Christopher’s head where he kneels directly across from Big C. Christopher’s mouth drips blood; he holds his jaw in pain and his heart races with fear. Big C glowers at Christopher. 
21. 
21.
BIG C 
What’s ya name? 
Terrified, Christopher is unable to speak. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
I’m not going to ask you again. 
My name. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(clears throat) 
My name is Christopher, Sir. 
BIG C 
Christopher. 
Donir passes Big C a Silver gun and Big C wipes it down. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Christopher, that sounds like a 
good boy name. 
Big C points the gun at Christopher. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Are you a good boy? 
Yes, sir. 
CHRISTOPHER BIG C 
Did you plan on dying today? 
No, sir. 
CHRISTOPHER BIG C 
You better have a good reason for 
following me? 
Christopher stares at Big C mute. Big C unlocks the gun. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I, I need a job. 
Christopher pulls the backpack off his back, he reaches into his bag slow and steady. He pulls out his resume. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I really need a job, Sir. 
He passes Big C his resume. 
22.
22. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I graduated high school 
Valedictorian. I was President of 
the Chess Club and CFO of our 
Philanthropic Company where we fund 
BIG C 
Stop talking. 
Big C looks at the resume, a devilish smile plasters across his face before his sinister laugh fills the room. He crumbles the paper and throws it at Christopher’s head. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Do I look like I need an Assistant? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m not asking for an 
administrative role, Sir. I’m 
looking for a sales job. 
BIG C 
(laughs louder) 
You don’t have the qualifications 
for that kind of position. 
CHRISTOPHER 
When I was in high school I sold 
answers to our regents exams. 
BIG C 
Aren’t you the Juvenile? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I sold my lunch snacks for twice 
the amount the Cafeteria sold them 
BIG C 
This isn’t high school, these 
streets are real life, it’s not a 
fucking game. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Respectfully, Sir, the streets are 
not my clientele. Think about 
College like the current appraisal 
gap between black and white 
homeowners. Properties owned by 
Caucasians are valued at more than 
the original cost of construction. 
In comparison, to those properties 
similar in nature, but owned by 
African Americans, valued at less.

(MORE)

23. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Americans are systematically 
programmed to believe that 
Caucasian equates to quality when 
it comes to the housing market. 
Big C looks at Christopher confused, he rubs his temples. Christopher stands up; raises his head more confident. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
In plain English, the students at 
University by default are prone to 
believe I have the better grade of 
product due to my ethnicity. 
BIG C 
Get him outta my face. 
Donir grabs Christopher by the shirt. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Please, Sir. Give me one chance to 
show you. Start me off with 
anything and I’ll do it for free. 
BIG C 
I’m not gonna say it again. 
Big C walks off. Donir grabs Christopher and puts the black bag over his head, He throws Christopher back into the SUV. 
EXT. PROJECTS - NIGHT 
The black bag is ripped from Christopher’s head and he squints his eyes. He looks around at his neighborhood in Brooklyn. Trae walks toward the car. 
DONIR 
Boss said to give him a brick. 
What! 
His call. 
TRAE DONIR TRAE 
Dis nigga smokin dat shit. 
Donir turns to Christopher and hands him a phone. 
DONIR 
When you’re done text 333 to the 
number in there. Get out. 
24. 
24.
Christopher climbs out of the SUV and it speeds off. 
TRAE 
Told you I see you soon. 
The pair walk through the projects. Christopher trails behind Trae slow, he glares at Trae’s shiny gun that rests on the back of Trae’s pants. Christopher’s heart beats fast. 
A notification flashes across Christopher’s phone: “Give Joshua his meds”. Christopher halts. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(stutters) 
Wait. I can’t do this. I apologize. 
I just. I can’t. 
Christopher hands Trae the phone Donir gave him. 
TRAE 
(chuckles) 
Smartest shit you said all day. 
Take your ass back to school, 
Einstein. Dis ain’t fa you. 
Christopher runs off toward his former residence. 
INT. PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Christopher walks inside of the building toward the elevator. He pushes the elevator button. The floor indicator is stuck on “9”. He pushes the elevator button again. Christopher pulls out his phone and shares his location with Matthew. 
He sighs heavy and heads toward the stair case; opens the door, walks up the fourteen flight of steps filled with garbage and urine. 
Christopher gets to the top of the steps, jumps back and SCREAMS, terrified at the zombie like HEROIN ADDICT hunch over as if he’s about to fall. 
Christopher races for the door and rushes into the hallway outside of Aunt Nancy’s apartment. Her entrance is wide open. 
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - KITCHEN 
Inside Joshua sits at the kitchen table with Yasir. Yasir snatches Joshua’s toys and hits him on the back of his head. 
25. 
25.
YASIR 
Hurry up an eat, Yo. I ain’t ya 
brother. I ain’t sittin here all 
night witchu. 
Joshua drops his head and cries loud. 
YASIR (CONT'D) 
Cryin ain’t gonna save you! 
Christopher barges into the apartment, toward the kitchen, with a scowl on his face, his fist are balled. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Don’t you ever put your hands on my 
brother again. 
Yasir sucks his teeth, stands up from his chair. 
YASIR 
Fuck you goin do? 
Yasir stands in Christopher’s face. Christopher stares at him. Aunt Nancy enters the kitchen. 
AUNT NANCY 
You two betta stop wit dis shit. 
Yasir backs down and exits. Aunt Nancy glares at Christopher before she exits. Christopher kneels in front of Joshua, he hugs him tight. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you ok? 
Joshua nods his head. Christopher wipes Joshua’s tears. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I’m sorry he did that to you. 
JOSHUA 
He’s only mean because I’m little. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I know... Did you take your meds? 
JOSHUA 
Yes... Can I go home with you now? 
(whines) 
I don’t like it here. 
Christopher rests his chin on top of Joshua’s head, his eyes water, he wipes the tears quick. 
26. 
26.
CHRISTOPHER 
Not yet, Buddy, I promise, I’m 
coming for you real soon. 
JOSHUA 
In a hundred and eighty six hours? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Maybe a little longer than that but 
trust me when I say, very soon. 
Ok. 
JOSHUA 
CHRISTOPHER 
Let’s get you in the bed. 
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Christopher undresses Joshua, he pulls his shirt over his head and sees a huge red welt across Joshua’s back. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What happened to your back? 
JOSHUA 
Nico wet the bed so Aunt Nancy gave 
us all a whooping with the cord. 
Christopher drops his head and exhales deep. He takes a picture of Joshua’s back. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Joshua look at me. If anyone, 
anyone, hits you again. I need you 
to get on your iPad and call me. 
Ok. 
JOSHUA 
Christopher tucks Joshua into the bed. He kisses Joshua’s head. They perform their handshake: YOU... ME... WE. 
JOSHUA (CONT'D) 
I love you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I love you so much more, you have 
no idea. Good night. 
Night. 
JOSHUA 
27. 
27.
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Aunt Nancy sits glued to the TV eating crab legs. Christopher storms in and holds the picture of Joshua’s back to her face. 
CHRISTOPHER 
If anyone in this house puts their 
hands on my brother again I’m going 
straight to the Police with this. 
Aunt Nancy jumps out of her seat. 
AUNT NANCY 
Whatchu not about ta do is come in 
dis bitch an tell me what to do in 
my god damn house. So feel free to 
get the fuck out! 
Christopher storms out of the house. 
AUNT NANCY (CONT'D) 
Don’t eva bring yo ass back here or 
Ima go straight to da Police and 
have you arrested for trespassin. 
INT. PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Christopher pushes the staircase door and rushes down the steps. He stops at the bottom and SCREAMS. He glides his hands over his head; while he paces back and forth. 
A text message from Matthew flashes across the screen: “Almost there”. Christopher stares fixated on the wallpaper of his phone: Christopher’s mom with Joshua and Christopher on her sides, they smile wide in coordinated outfits. 
EXT. PROJECTS - NIGHT 
Christopher walks toward Trae who sells drugs to someone on the block. 
I’m ready. 
CHRISTOPHER TRAE 
I thought you bitched up. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I can’t... I just needed a second, I’m ready now. 
28. 
28.
TRAE 
I ain’t got time to be takin long 
walks around the projects wit you 
gazin at the stars. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I apologize for any inconvenience 
my delay may have caused. Please 
give me what was promised. 
They walk through the Projects towards another building. 
TRAE 
How da hell did you convince dis 
nigga to give you a brick? 
Christopher looks around fearful. 
CHRISTOPHER 
The same way you did. 
TRAE 
Yea, aight... What you scared for 
nigga? You in my hood, ain’t nobody 
gonna do shit to you. 
Trae whistles and taps on a window three times. Someone inside passes Trae a Bible. Trae passes the book to Christopher. Christopher looks at him dumbfounded. 
CHRISTOPHER 
This is a Bible. I was supposed to 
be getting a brick of coke? 
TRAE 
First off, shut the fuck up. 
Second, you sure you got dis? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Yes, I just need the product so I 
Page 59. What? 
TRAE 
CHRISTOPHER TRAE 
Nigga, open da damn book. 
Christopher opens the Bible. The pages are cut out and on page 59 is a brick of coke. He shuts the book and places it in his book bag. 
29. 
29.
TRAE (CONT'D) 
May da Lord be witchu. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Wait. Help me please, show me how 
to sell like you. 
TRAE 
Ain’t no manual to dis shit. You 
got it or you don’t. 
Christopher drops his head and sighs. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
Nice knowin you, Einstein. 
Christopher walks toward the street; he waits for Matthew. 
EXT. MATTHEW’S CAR - NIGHT 
Matthew jumps up and down, smiles from ear to ear. His face sweaty, he hugs Christopher tight. 
MATTHEW 
I thought I lost you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You almost did. 
MATTHEW 
What the hell happened, Bro? 
CHRISTOPHER 
They pulled me out of the car. 
Punched me in my face 
MATTHEW 
Did you meet El Cafe? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Yea, him and his shiny gun. 
Matthew’s eyes light up with joy. 
MATTHEW 
This sounds like a Scar Face scene. 
CHRISTOPHER 
This isn’t a movie. Do you see what 
they did to my lip? 
They climb in the car and speed off. 
30. 
30.
INT. MATTHEW'S CAR - NIGHT 
Matthew sits up in his seat, energetic and excited. 
MATTHEW 
I’m sorry, Bro. What did he say? 
CHRISTOPHER 
We’ll talk about it when we get 
back to the room. There’s way too 
much going on right now. 
MATTHEW 
I know, I’m feeling the adrenaline. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you ok? 
MATTHEW 
I’m just so happy you’re alive, I’m 
alive. We both aren’t dead. 
Matthew drives fast and excited, oblivious to his speed. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Slow down, Matt. 
Matthew slows down when the COPS, drive behind them. He bangs on the steering wheel agitated and pulls over. Christopher looks out of the mirror terrified and belligerent. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
No, no, no. 
MATTHEW 
Don’t worry, Bro. I’ll handle this. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Don’t you say anything, Matt. Just 
shh, shhh, shut the, don’t say 
anything. Mat 
Matthew’s window goes down and he sticks his head out. 
MATTHEW 
Excuse me, Officers, what the hell 
are we being pulled over for? This 
is embarrassing. 
Christopher sits paralyzed. OFFICER OLIVER (40’s Caucasian and grim) shines his light in Matthew’s face. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Is that really necessary? 
31. 
31.
OFFICER OLIVER 
License and registration please. 
MATTHEW 
What? What for? Why are we being 
pulled over? 
OFFICER XAVIER (40’s; African American and laxed) shines his light in Christopher’s face. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Can you both please stop with this 
damn light. 
Matthew opens the door and hops out of the car. 
EXT. MATTHEW’S CAR - NIGHT 
Matthew steps in Oliver’s face. 
MATTHEW 
Do you know who my dad is? 
Officer Oliver pushes Matthew to the car. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Ask your mom and shut up, before I 
arrest you. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
(To Christopher) 
Sir, do you mind stepping out of 
the vehicle. 
MATTHEW 
Yes, he does mind. You have yet to 
tell us what we are being pulled 
over for. You know what? 
Matthew reaches in the car and grabs his phone. Officer Oliver grabs Matthew; slams him against the car, cuffs him. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
What are you doing? This is a 
violation of my rights. 
Officer Oliver drags Matthew to the Police Car and shoves him in to the backseat. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
I told you to shut up. 
Officer Xavier flashes his light on Christopher. 
32. 
32.
OFFICER XAVIER 
Are you going to be uncooperative 
like your friend? 
No, Sir. 
CHRISTOPHER OFFICER XAVIER 
Please step out of the vehicle. 
Christopher climbs out of the car. 
INT/EXT. MATTHEW’S LAVISH CAR - NIGHT 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Did you realize your friend was 
speeding? 
CHRISTOPHER 
No Sir, he’s been having a bad day, but I don’t recall any speeding. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Do you have any drugs or weapons in the car? 
No, Sir. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Officer Oliver begins to search the driver’s side. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Have you consumed any alcohol or 
illegal substances? 
No, Sir. 
CHRISTOPHER 
The sweat drips down Christopher’s face. Officer Oliver searches the backseat of Matthew’s car. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Where are you guys headed to? 
CHRISTOPHER 
On our way back to school. 
Officer Oliver searches the passenger side. He pulls Christopher’s bag and looks through his books. Christopher’s heart stops. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Look what we have here. 
33. 
33.
Officer Oliver holds up the coke stuffed into the Bible. 
Officer Xavier SLAMS Christopher against the car, cuffs him. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
You want to tell me what this is? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I have no clue, Sir. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Maybe you’ll remember when we bring 
your ass down to county. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Sir, that isn’t mine. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
You were holding this bag. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I didn’t know that was in there. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
You don’t really know much about 
anything do you? 
Officer Oliver looks at the coke. 
OFFICER OLIVER (CONT'D) 
I’m thinking a minimum of 5 years 
prison sentence, if it’s your first 
offense. You’ll be out just in time 
for graduation. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Please, Sir. You have to believe 
me. That’s not mine. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Tell me who’s is it? 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Your friend over there, is it his? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I have no clue how it got in there. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Think long and hard because unless 
you can tell me who gave this to 
you in the next two minutes. Both 
of you are going to prison for a 
long time. 
34. 
34.
Christopher sits on the curb defeated. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know, Officer. I don’t even 
read the Bible. I’m just coming 
from an interview. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
An interview for what UFC? What 
happened to your lip? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I slipped and fell on the floor in 
the bathroom. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
So you’re a klutz and you have 
amnesia. All plausible disabilities 
when you’re going against a judge. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
We just need a name. And then you 
and your friend can go and rest 
peacefully in your dorm and not in 
a jail cell. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know, Officer. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
I don’t have time for this shit. 
Officer Oliver chokes Christopher with his stick. 
OFFICER OLIVER (CONT'D) 
Who gave it to you? A kilo of coke 
doesn’t just magically appear in 
your book bag. 
Christopher struggles to breathe. Officer Oliver releases him and Christopher coughs hard. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(muffled) 
I don’t know how it got there. 
Officer Oliver walks over to Matthew in the police car. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
(whispers to Christopher) 
Just say it’s your friend’s, he’s 
probably over there giving you up. 
Don’t go down for his shit. 
35. 
35.
CHRISTOPHER 
I can’t do that, Officer, I don’t 
know who’s it is. But it’s not 
anyone of ours. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
(shrugs shoulders) 
I tried to help. 
Officer Oliver releases Matthew from the backseat and takes the cuffs off of him. They walk towards Christopher. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
He said the bag is yours. 
What?! 
CHRISTOPHER 
Officer Xavier grabs Christopher and forces him towards the police car. 
MATTHEW 
Don’t say anything, my dad is going 
to get you out. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What did you say? That’s not mine. 
Officer Xavier pushes Christopher into the backseat of the car. Without hesitation, Matthew gets in his car and drives. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
I told you. 
Christopher sits in the back, his thoughts race. Officer Oliver gets in the car and they drive off. 
INT/EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Officer Oliver looks at Christopher through the rear view mirror. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
I’m going to ask you one more time. 
Who gave you the coke? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Please don’t ask me anything until 
my attorney is present. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
5-10 years to cover someone else’s 
ass. Couldn’t be me. 
36. 
36.
Christopher looks out the window and stares at the dark and empty highway, he can’t help it, the tears flood his eyes, he sobs. The car exits the highway and parks in a dark alleyway. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
You did good. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Yea, besides you crying like a 
little bitch. I’d give you a C. 
Officer Xavier opens the door for Christopher and takes off the handcuffs. 
OFFICER OLIVER (CONT'D) 
Next time, if you’re going to say 
you don’t know how it got there, 
put it in the trunk. 
Officer Oliver passes Christopher his yellow book bag. Christopher looks at them both confused. 
OFFICER XAVIER 
The boss will be in touch. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m free to go? 
OFFICER XAVIER 
Hurry up bef 
Christopher dashes down the street, he runs at full speed. 
OFFICER OLIVER 
Run Forest! 
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Christopher halts to catch his breath. Hunched over, his chest falls hard, he holds his bag to his chest. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thank you, God! I promise, I’m 
going to read the Bible. 
INT. CHRISTOPHER'S DORM - NIGHT 
Christopher enters the dorm room and collapses on his bag of clothes. Matthew is on the phone, his eyes widen. 
37. 
37.
MATTHEW 
You’re here! I’m trying to get a 
hold of my dad. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You don’t have to do that. 
MATTHEW 
Hell if I don’t. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Hang up the phone, Matthew. 
Matthew hangs up the phone and throws it on the bed. 
MATTHEW 
What’s wrong with you? What they 
did to us violates every single 
right we have as an American. They 
still didn’t even tell me what we 
were being pulled over for. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Just let it go, Matt. We are here, 
we’re not in prison. I just want to 
shower and go to sleep. 
MATTHEW 
What! They are both going down, 
they can’t get away with that. 
Christopher pulls out the Bible and shows Matthew the coke. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Yes, they can. 
Matthew’s eyes light up, he smiles from ear to ear. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
They let me get away with this. In 
turn, they can get away with 
violating whatever rights you think 
we have. 
MATTHEW 
Where did you get that? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Doesn’t matter. 
Matthew stares at the coke, balls his fist in excitement. 
38. 
38.
MATTHEW 
Dude, this really is some Scar Face 
shit. I’m in a Scar Face movie 
right now. I need to get a gun. 
Matthew picks up the remote control; points it in the air. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Say hello to my little 
Jasmine barges through the door. 
INT. CHRISTOPHER’S DORM - NIGHT 
Surprised, Matthew cowers. Jasmine’s eyes fill with anger. 
JASMINE 
I trust you have a very good reason 
for not 
Christopher covers the coke with haste. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Returning any of my calls. What is 
that Christopher Prince? 
Shhh! 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher pushes Jasmine in the room and shuts the door. 
JASMINE 
Christopher, why do you have coke 
in your dorm room? In a Bible? 
MATTHEW 
That was clever. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Shh, everyone just please. Give me 
a second to think. 
Christopher closes his eyes. Matthew and Jasmine stare. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I can feel you staring. 
JASMINE 
You’re about to feel my punch if 
you don’t answer my question. What 
are you doing? 
39. 
39.
MATTHEW 
Give him a break, Sexy. The man has 
been through enough. 
JASMINE 
OK, so what? Let’s do some coke to 
get rid of our problems. You’ve 
been on campus for a couple of 
hours and you’re already doing some 
white people shit? 
Hey, Sexy! 
MATTHEW JASMINE 
Call me sexy one more time. 
Matthew takes a seat on his bed and crosses his legs. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I need this Jazz, my Aunt exhausted 
my trust fund, I owe $25,000 in 
tuition, where am I going to get 
that much money? 
JASMINE 
Christopher, they have 
scholarships, grants, fellowships. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I tried, those could take months to 
receive. I can’t go back to 
Brooklyn. 
JASMINE 
Because that’s worse than jail? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I won’t go to jail. 
MATTHEW 
Yea, he definitely won’t, if you 
knew what we just went 
JASMINE 
Shut up, Bieber... You’re not 
thinking, what good are you to 
Joshua if you’re in jail? 
CHRISTOPHER 
What good am I to Joshua now?! 
Everything I’m doing is for him. 
This school, the drugs, everything. 
40.
40. 
Christopher rubs his hands over his head and sighs. 
JASMINE 
You don’t know anything about 
selling drugs, Christopher. What 
would your mother think if she knew 
you were doing this? 
Christopher bangs his hand on the dresser. 
CHRISTOPHER 
This is happening, Jazz. Now you 
can help me or you can kindly 
excuse yourself so Matt and I can 
figure this out. 
Jasmine glares at Christopher and exits the room. 
MATTHEW 
She is alluring as hell. 
Christopher stares at the floor deep in thought. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
So how are we going to do this? Can 
I be one of your workers and like 
make deliveries and shit? All the 
bitches love the dope boys. 
Christopher’s lips curl, he looks at Matthew disgusted. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Who are you? And what are you 
pretending to be? 
MATTHEW 
Dude, we are about to be bigger 
than Frank Matthews. Everyone is 
going to know who I am. You’re 
going to be begging for my SWAG. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Who is Frank Matthews? 
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Jasmine paces back and forth outside, filled with fury. 
JASMINE 
(to herself) 
Just leave him alone, Jazz. Don’t 
you dare get involved. Think with 
your mind and not your heart. 
(MORE) 
(MORE) 
41.
41. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Well, both of you like him so 
that’s not helpful... AH!!! 
Jasmine halts; she stares at a COUPLE kissing on a bench 
nearby with a wistful yearning for their sexual chemistry. 
INT. CHRISTOPHER'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Christopher and Matthew brain storm. On the white board a SWOT Analysis is written. Christopher stands at the board with the marker in his hand. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Opportunities? Few competitors. 
MATTHEW 
No competitors, when we come out. 
CHRISTOPHER 
That’s the spirit... But I need you 
to focus... There’s definitely a 
need for my services. 
Christopher writes on the board. 
MATTHEW 
Hell yea. Everyone does coke now. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Threats? The Police. 
MATTHEW 
We don’t have to worry about that. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Lack of knowledge 
A knock on the door startles the two. Matthew quickly climbs under the bed. 
MATTHEW 
The cops are back. 
Christopher stares at the door. 
Who is it? It’s me. 
CHRISTOPHER JASMINE (O.S.) 
Christopher opens the door and Jasmine barges in. 
42. 
42.
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
I would like to go on record and 
say I do not condone any of this, I 
am here solely for moral support. 
MATTHEW (O.S.) 
We could use the help. 
Jasmine looks at Matthew’s bed. 
JASMINE 
I’m not even going to ask. 
Christopher sits doleful, he fidgets with his fingers. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t even know where to start. 
JASMINE 
Let’s start with your elevator 
pitch. What are you going to say to 
potential clients? 
Christopher taps the marker on his lip. He stands up; crosses his arms, glowers. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(mimics Trae) 
Ayo, what you tryna cop, Elvis? 
Jasmine and Matthew gaze at Christopher in silence before they both- laugh LOUD. Christopher sits down, pouts. 
JASMINE 
What the hell was that? 
MATTHEW 
That was hilarious. Do it again. 
CHRISTOPHER 
A prime example of the fact that I 
have no clue what I’m doing. 
JASMINE 
I’m sorry, I don’t mean to laugh. 
Let’s just start with something 
easier. What’s the name? 
Christopher points to the white board. Jasmine raises her brows, confused. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
What is Qawiun? 
43. 
43.
CHRISTOPHER 
Qawiun, means powerful in Arabic. 
JASMINE 
How do you say, absolutely 
terrible, in Arabic? 
CHRISTOPHER 
If I’m going to sell something, the 
presentation is just as important 
as the product. 
JASMINE 
Agreed, but this is not giving... 
You know what? Let’s go. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Where are we going? I can’t leave I 
have to figure this out. 
JASMINE 
We are going to go do some real 
research... Trust me. 
Christopher hides the coke and puts his shirt on. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Take a little bit. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What’s a little bit? 
JASMINE 
How should I know? 
They turn to Matthew. 
MATTHEW 
Pinky size, I guess? But don’t let 
your skin touch it or else it will 
seep in you pores. 
CHRISTOPHER 
How am I suppose to get it out? 
MATTHEW 
I’ve got it. 
Matthew takes a razor blade and scoops the coke in two small containers with ease. Christopher and Jasmine stand with their shirts over their nose glued to Matthew’s every move. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
I can hold this if you want me to. 
44.
44. 
JASMINE 
(side-eyed) 
Absolutely not, you did that way 
too easy. 
Jasmine snatches the containers from Matthew. She pockets one and passes the other to Christopher. 
MATTHEW 
I watch a lot of gangster movies. 
Christopher stashes the bag away. They all exit the room. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Christopher, Matthew, and Jasmine walk into the party filled with STUDENTS. Music blasts, alcohol fills the air. 
MATTHEW 
Now this is what I’m talking about. 
JASMINE 
Slow down, Joyner. 
MATTHEW 
What’s the plan? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Let’s get a feel for our clientele. 
MATTHEW 
I see some girls over there I want 
to get a feel for. 
Focus. 
CHRISTOPHER JASMINE 
Let’s call it, Hades. 
MATTHEW 
I like it, come dance with the 
Devil, ladies. 
Matthew exits. Christopher turns to Jasmine. 
Hades? 
CHRISTOPHER JASMINE 
It draws you in, in like a dark kind of way.(MORE)

JASMINE (CONT'D) 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Let’s just see if it sticks. I’m 
going to the bathroom. That’s 
usually where the magic is. 
Jasmine walks off. Christopher walks around the house and into the kitchen filled with drunk students. He walks through a dim hallway and past a couple; they tongue kiss. 
IN. PARTY HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Christopher walks into another room where multiple people kiss. The lights are faint and red, the music is slow. Christopher opens the door to a big room. The music blasts and there’s foam everywhere. Caraleigh jumps from the crowd. 
CARALEIGH 
Hey, Christopher. I didn’t know you 
were going to be here. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Neither did I. I’m actually about 
to leave. Looking for my friends. 
CARALEIGH 
You can’t leave yet. The party is 
just getting started. 
Caraleigh grabs Christopher’s arms and wraps them around her. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I guess I can stay for a minute. 
The two walk down a dark hall. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Caraleigh opens the door to a private room. She leads Christopher inside. Pushes him on the bed. 
CARALEIGH 
Get comfy. I’m going to get out of 
these wet clothes. 
She walks into the en suite bathroom. 
CARALEIGH (O.S) (CONT'D) 
Don’t worry. This is my friend 
Lisa’s house. Her parents are at 
some Meditation retreat. 
CHRISTOPHER 
She knows how to throw a party. 
46. 
46.
Caraleigh comes out in a towel. 
CARALEIGH 
She’s an only child. 
Caraleigh gets dressed in front of Christopher. She pulls out a bag of coke and empties the contents on a dresser nearby. 
Christopher gazes, glued to her every move. She snorts the coke off the dresser and offers some to Christopher. 
CARALEIGH (CONT'D) 
Sharing is caring? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m ok, thanks. 
CARALEIGH 
Don’t tell me you’re one of those. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Not at all, mine is better. 
Christopher shows Caraleigh the plastic container. 
May I try? 
CARALEIGH CHRISTOPHER 
Sharing is caring. 
Caraleigh empties some of the coke on the dresser. She snorts another line; dabs the residue and wipes her teeth. 
CARALEIGH 
Ooooo, yea. I like this one better. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Call me anytime you want some. 
CARALEIGH 
(smirks) 
I will. 
She pushes Christopher back; hovers over, kisses him. She unbuckles his pants and spits a huge glob of saliva on his penis when- Matthew barges in to the room. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Matthew stumbles, falls to the floor, his nose red, the sweat glistens his face. 
47. 
47.
MATTHEW 
I’ve been looking for you 
everywhere, Bro. 
Christopher pulls up his pants up in a panic. Three girls walk into the room. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
These girls want Hades! 
Matthew gets up; unable to balance himself, he falls against Christopher, speaks loud in his face. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Please tell me you have some more. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Clearly my friend is inebriated. My 
apologies ladies... 
Christopher grabs Matthew and holds him up while they walk out of the room. 
MATTHEW 
They’re naughty, naughty girls. 
Let’s take them to Hell. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Let’s take you home. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Christopher rushes through the house and walks toward the bathroom where Jasmine was headed. They barge in and stand paralyzed as Jasmine seemingly sniffs a line of coke. 
MATTHEW 
That’s how we party! 
CHRISTOPHER 
We have to go. 
JASMINE 
Wait, these girls were just asking 
for, Hades. 
Hades! 
MATTHEW 
The girls in the bathroom scream with excitement. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Next time, we have to get him home. 
48. 
48.
Jasmine walks out of the bathroom confused. 
INT. MATTHEW’S CAR - NIGHT 
Jasmine helps Matthew into the backseat. Christopher and Jasmine climb in the car. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What was that, Jazz? 
JASMINE 
I didn’t sniff anything, Chris. I 
had to make it look like I was 
doing some so they could feel 
comfortable. Why do you think I had 
my back turned? 
Thank God. 
CHRISTOPHER JASMINE 
You know me better than that. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I do. Thats why I was shocked. 
JASMINE 
They fell for it though, they loved 
the product. Not that they would 
know the difference. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Why did you do that?! We were only 
suppose to go and scope out the 
place, nothing more! 
JASMINE 
Why are you screaming at me, I was 
helping you? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(breathes deep) 
I’m sorry... It was there, Jazz, 
plenty of opportunity. I just, felt 
overwhelmed, I couldn’t. What the 
fuck am I doing? 
Christopher takes another deep breath. Jasmine places her hand on his. They drive in silence. 
49. 
49.
INT. VISTA BANK - BATHROOM - DAY 
Christopher splashes water over his face and reaches for the paper towels. He goes into the stall; sits on the toilet, rests his head. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s your first day, Christopher, 
you need to wake up. 
Donald rushes into the bathroom and barges into the stall next to Christopher’s. Donald sniffs a line of coke. 
Christopher sits still and quiet when his phone falls from his pocket. Startled, Donald drops the coke on the floor, some of the contents spills from the wrapper. 
Disheveled, Donald picks up the wrapper, wipes the coke from the floor, and rushes out of the stall. Christopher retrieves his phone, flushes the toilet, and walks out. 
DONALD 
Hey! I didn’t know anyone else was 
in here. 
Christopher washes his hands afraid to speak. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Allergies beat you too? 
DONALD 
They are a killer during this time. 
CHRISTOPHER 
My little brother has a bad case. 
Christopher grabs the paper towel and dries his hands. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I hope you feel better, Sir. 
Thank you. 
DONALD 
Christopher walks out. Donald looks in the mirror, he thinks he’s in the clear when Christopher walks in more confident. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Donnie, I have something way better 
than what you lost if you’re 
interested? 
50. 
50.
DONALD 
I think you should walk out of this 
bathroom and never speak about what 
happened here again. 
Christopher’s confidence deflates. 
Yes, Sir. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher leaves the bathroom, his head low. 
INT. CHRISTOPHER'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Jasmine and Christopher sit in his dorm room. 
JASMINE 
I made you something. Remember when 
you told me packaging is just as 
important as the product? 
Jasmine reaches in her bag and pulls out a sheet full of small stickers with a three headed dog, Cerberus. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Cerberus is Hades’ dog, he guards 
the gates of the Underworld to 
prevent the dead from leaving. 
CHRISTOPHER 
These are amazing. You drew this? 
JASMINE 
I did and then digitized it. I 
figure it could go with the whole 
Hades theme. 
Christopher smiles from ear to ear, beyond excited. 
CHRISTOPHER 
This is fantastic, this is the 
marketing I need. Thank you, Jazz. 
I don’t know how but at some point 
I will be able to return the favor. 
JASMINE 
(hesitant) 
I know how. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Absolutely, tell me, anything you 
need. Except money, you know I 
don’t have that. 
51. 
51.
Jasmine fidgets with her fingers unable to make eye contact. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Talk to me, you know you can tell 
me anything. 
I know. 
JASMINE 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’ve been waiting a while for you to FINALLY let me hel 
JASMINE 
Let’s have sex. 
What? 
CHRISTOPHER JASMINE 
Nothing, I’m sorry that was 
intense. 
Christopher sits silent. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
It’s ok, we don’t have to. I knew 
it was too much to ask. 
More silence. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
Say something. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m lost for words. 
JASMINE 
Don’t overthink this. Come on you 
have some money to make. 
Jasmine packs up her belongings. Christopher puts the drugs in his bright yellow book bag and stashes the bag in a secret hiding place. He takes a few packages and throws them in another book bag. He stares at Jasmine by the door. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You just want to have sex or like 
be my. What do you... 
Jasmine drops her head and stares at the floor. 
52. 
52.
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Have you ever done this before? I 
thought losing your virginity is 
like insanely serious to girls? 
More silence. Christopher drops his head. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I’m just trying to understand why 
me? It’s going to hurt, you know? 
JASMINE 
I know, but you’re not going to 
hurt me. 
Christopher walks up to Jasmine and hugs her tight. He swipes her hair from her face and looks her deep in the eyes. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I would never. You’ve been there 
for me more times than numerically 
possible. I can’t ignore the one 
time you ask me for something. 
He grabs her by the shoulders and guides her towards the bed. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Just tell me to stop, whenever, ok? 
(nods) 
Ok. 
JASMINE 
Christopher takes his shirt off. Jasmine stands immobile. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Touch me. I want you to feel 
comfortable. 
JASMINE 
I don’t know if I can. 
CHRISTOPHER 
We’ll go slow. 
Their eyes lock. Christopher pulls Jasmine in by her waist and traces her arms to her elbow. He brings her hands around his neck. Christopher jerks, they both chuckle. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Your hands are freezing. 
I’m sorry. 
JASMINE 
53. 
53.
He takes her hands and rubs them between his. He blows on her hands. Jasmine stands awkward but lustful, transfixed on his every move. Christopher catches her lascivious look and leans in slow for a gentle kiss. Forehead to forehead, he whispers. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Can I take your pants off? 
Jasmine nods. Christopher unbuckles her pants pulls them down. She climbs in the bed; shy and awkward while Christopher takes his off and climbs in with her. Christopher opens the night stand and pulls out a condom. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
This is called a condom. 
JASMINE 
(chuckles) 
I know what it is. Stop playing 
with me. 
Ready? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Jasmine nods. Christopher puts on the condom, positions himself on top. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I want to hear you say it. 
Yes. 
JASMINE 
Slow and careful he enters Jasmine. She gasps in pain; squeezes his arms tight while she tries not to scream. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you ok? 
JASMINE 
Yes. 
(muffled) 
CHRISTOPHER 
Do you want me to stop? 
No. 
JASMINE 
CHRISTOPHER 
Relax for me. 
Jasmine buries her face in her arms, wrapped around Christopher’s neck, her teeth clench. 
54. 
54.
Christopher strokes her slow and gentle. He stares at her face in pain and picks up the pace until... He erupts. He collapses on top of her while he breathes hard on her neck. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Are you ok? 
Yes. 
JASMINE 
CHRISTOPHER 
I know it hurt. I tried not to. I 
don’t think there’s anyway around 
that. 
JASMINE 
It’s ok, I’m ok. Thank you. 
They both laugh then stare at the ceiling in awkward silence. 
INT. VISTA BANK - OFFICE - DAY 
Donald is at his desk, when Christopher walks in. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Here’s the report you asked for. 
Christopher drops the paper on the desk and rushes out. 
Wait, Kid. 
DONALD 
Christopher stops in his tracks. 
DONALD (CONT'D) 
This looks good, really good. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thank you, Sir. 
DONALD 
Close the door and join me. 
Christopher closes the door and sits across from Donald. 
DONALD (CONT'D) 
You said you have something better? 
CHRISTOPHER 
No sir, I guarantee you, I found 
those stats from reputable sources, 
I referenced them ri-. 
55. 
55.
Donald stares at Christopher. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Oh you mean? Yes I do. 
DONALD 
Your mom is probably going to come 
haunt me at night but I need a lot. 
I have some big clients in town and 
I’m hosting a party. 
Got it. 
CHRISTOPHER DONALD 
Christopher, I can’t stress the 
importance of this staying between 
us.(whispers) 
I think there are undercover drug 
agents working here. Your mother 
knew it, before she died she was 
working on something big. 
CHRISTOPHER 
My mom never mentioned anything. Do you know what she was working on? 
DONALD 
I’m not sure but it pissed the 
wrong people off. So I need this 
and YOU to stay under the radar. 
Donald passes him a piece of paper. 
DONALD (CONT'D) 
Drop it off here. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Will do, Sir. 
DONALD 
Stop calling me, Sir. 
Christopher nods his head. 
Go! 
DONALD (CONT'D) CHRISTOPHER 
Oh, yes, see you soon, Sir. I mean. See you later. 
56. 
56.
Christopher walks out of the office, he shuts the door and does a silent victory dance. 
INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY 
The black bag is ripped off of Christopher’s head and he sits across Big C while TWO STRIPPERS dance naked on a stage. 
BIG C 
You got something for me. 
Yes, Sir. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher pulls out the money. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Fifty thousand dollars. 
BIG C 
I ain’t think you could pull dis 
shit off. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I told you I could. 
Big C hands the money to Donir. Donir exits. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
It’s all there. I counted like aa 
hundred times. 
BIG C 
It better be. 
Big C passes Christopher money. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What’s this? 
BIG C 
Bricks are $45,000. That’s yours. 
5K. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I told you, I would do it for free 
the first time around. 
BIG C 
Do I look like I need your charity? 
57. 
57.
CHRISTOPHER 
No, Sir... Will I be able to get 
another one? 
Big C points to the stripper dancing. 
BIG C 
You like this one? 
CHRISTOPHER 
She’s pretty. 
BIG C 
Would you fuck her? 
Christopher looks down. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Are you gay nigga? I ain’t got none 
of that shit in here 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m not gay. 
BIG C 
You never seen pussy before? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I honestly just want to get what I 
came for and leave. 
BIG C 
That’s good. 
Big C slaps Christopher in the back of the head. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
You gotta good head on your 
shoulders. 
INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY 
Big C’s SOLDIERS walk in. Donir drags Trae and another known drug dealer, PECAN (20’s; hard on the outside) into the club. Donir throws them on the floor. 
BIG C 
Unlike some other people. 
Big C walks towards Trae and Pecan. 
58. 
58.
BIG C (CONT'D) 
I put you motherfuckers in charge 
of 40th and somehow none of you 
dickheads were there when the block 
got hit. 
Donir passes Big C a black .45. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Since I’m a nice guy and I don’t 
want to make my own assumptions. 
Ima give you one chance to tell me 
where the fuck you were? 
PECAN 
I swear I didn’t set you up, C. 
When I heard they hit the block 
BIG C 
I said, where the fuck were you? 
PECAN 
I was at Pebbles with 
Big C shoots Pecan in the head and the blood swarms the floor. Christopher sits terrified, his eyes pop. 
BIG C 
Let this be a lesson to everyone in 
here who thinks getting pussy is 
more important than making money. 
Big C turns toward Trae. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
You gotta be the biggest 
disappointment of em all. I gave 
you that block, gave you the food 
from MY plate. 
Big C aims the gun at Trae’s head. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
And you let some lil niggas from 
the East side step on ya neck. How 
the fuck did that happen? 
Trae on his knees, keeps his head hide, he knows nothing he can say will save him. Big C lowers the gun and points toward Trae’s genitals. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Chasing pussy too, wasn’t you? 
I was 
TRAE 
59. 59.
BOOM. Big C shoots Trae. Trae falls back and SCREAMS in pain, the blood soaks his clothing. 
BIG C 
Now nobody getting no pussy. 
Christopher is horrified, scared to even breathe. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Anybody else in this room, need a 
refresher? 
Big C looks around the room sizing up his soldiers. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
No. Anyone else want to end up like 
these two motherfuckers? 
Big C presses the gun against Trae’s head. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
I hope that bitch was wor 
Christopher interrupts, the words leave his mouth before he can think. 
CHRISTOPHER 
He was with me. 
Christopher can’t believe he just spoke- no one in the room can either. 
BIG C 
Whatchu say, School Boy? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(swallows hard) 
I said he was with me, Sir. Showing 
me the ropes, helping me bring in 
my clientele. He’s the reason I 
sold my product quickly. 
BIG C 
You don’t think that was worth 
mentioning two minutes ago. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I wasn’t really sure what you were 
referencing, Sir. 
60. 
60.
BIG C 
(To his soldiers) 
Fix this nigga up. 
One of Big C’s soldiers grabs Trae and carries him out of the room. Big C points to another one of his soldiers. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Clean this shit up. Everybody out. 
Everyone in the room clears out. Donir grabs Christopher and puts the black bag over his head. 
Big C looks toward a WOMAN sitting in the corner, her glare pierces his eyes. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
Yo D, take the bag off, he don’t 
need it. 
Donir removes the black bag. Christopher walks off; head high, huge grin across his face. 
INT. LIBRARY - LATER 
Matthew runs up to Christopher; hugs him tight. Sweat seeps out of Matthew’s shirt. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Where have you been? 
MATTHEW 
Only coming up with the best idea 
in the whole world. 
Matthew passes Christopher the flyer. “Millionaire Row the ultimate party for everyone who is anyone, hosted by Christopher Prince and Matthew Wharton” 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
We are going to throw the ultimate 
party bigger than the one we went 
to. I already got Lisa to let us 
throw it at her house. Tons of 
clientele under one roof, Chris. 
CHRISTOPHER 
That is a great idea. I could kiss 
you right now, Matt. 
61. 
61.
MATTHEW 
Pump your breaks, Bro. I spoke with 
the radio station and they are 
promoting the party on air. 
Matthew swipes his nose and sniffles. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you ok? You look sick. 
MATTHEW 
Yea, my allergies are killing me... 
I’m going to go finish passing out 
these flyers... HADES! 
Matthew runs off. Christopher sits at the table he practices his elevator pitch. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’ve got Hades, let it burn. No, 
that sucks... Hades, Hades, no 
better feeling. Even worse. 
He rest his hands in his face. Christopher gets up and walks toward the restroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Christopher walks in, another student, ISAAC (18; pleasant) stands at the sink washing his hands. Christopher walks up to the sink and does the same. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Long day, huh? 
ISAAC 
Calculus is the devil, word of 
advice, don’t take, Mr. McGinit’s 
class; loves pop quizzes more than 
he loves his wife. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(chuckles) 
Thanks for the tip. I’m pretty good 
at Calculus, I’m happy to help if 
you need some tutoring. 
ISAAC 
Really, Bro? That would be awesome. 
My dad is going to kill me if I 
fail again. 
62. 
62.
CHRISTOPHER 
Sure, no problem, take my number, 
I’m happy to help. 
Isaac passes Christopher his phone and Christopher puts his number in. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I’m Christopher. 
ISAAC 
Isaac. I just texted you. 
They shake hands. 
CHRISTOPHER 
And if you need something extra to 
help you study. I’m sure you’ve 
heard about, Hades. 
ISAAC 
Hades! Who hasn’t? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Really? I mean. 
(clears throat) 
Really who hasn’t? 
ISAAC 
I’ve been looking for Hades for a 
while. These girls were raving 
about it at a party I went to. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You know how women are when they 
get to talking. 
ISAAC 
The way the word is spreading, I’m 
sure Hades will be the next thing 
we legalize in America. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(chuckles) 
I have some here if you want? 
ISAAC 
Hell yea! Pun intended. 
They both laugh. Christopher pulls out a plastic package and passes it to Isaac. 
ISAAC (CONT'D) 
This packaging is sweet! 
63. 
63.
Christopher logs in to his bank app. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thanks. I just sent you a request 
with Zelle. 
ISAAC 
For sure, just got it, and sending 
payment now. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Got it, thanks. 
ISAAC 
No, thank you. Do you mind if I 
share your number with some buddies 
of mine? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Not at all. 
ISAAC 
Perfect. See you around. 
Isaac exits the bathroom. Christopher looks in the mirror and smiles wide. He beats on his chest. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(mimics Trae) 
Yea, What you tryna cop, Elvis? 
SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS 
Christopher sells to STUDENT A (20’s; nerdy) on campus. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Excuse me, I don’t mean to bother 
you. I just wanted to introduce 
myself, I’m Christopher. 
STUDENT A 
Hey, what’s up? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Oh, you know typical statistic 
walking around campus selling drugs 
trying to be as discreet as a 6’3 
black man possibly can.

You’re cute. What are you selling?

CHRISTOPHER 
64. 64.
EXT. CAMPUS - PARKING LOT - DAY 
Christopher sells to STUDENT B (18; girl next door). 
STUDENT B 
Hades?! Like hell? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Yes, but not the negative 
annotation of hell that you’re 
referencing. It’s more like 
(leans in close) 
Where the hell have you been my 
whole life? 
Student B blushes she taps him gently on his chest. 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
Christopher sells to STUDENT C (20’s; LGBT, cheerful).

Yaaasssss, Sign me up, or should I 
say sign me down?! 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
Christopher sells to STUDENT D (20’s; licentious). 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s called Hades, like HELL-O. 
STUDENT D 
(bites lip) 
Sounds hot. Does that make you the 
Devil? 
Maybe. 
CHRISTOPHER 
65. 
65.
STUDENT D 
Are you going to punish me? 
Maybe. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher wraps his arm around Student D. She fawns over his charm. 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

INT. CHRISTOPHER'S DORM - DAY 
Christopher smiles while he counts his money. 
END SERIES OF SHOTS 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - LATER 
Christopher and Matthew eat in the food court. Matthew’s nose is red as if he has a cold. Christopher wipes ketchup off the same tattered suit he always wears. 
MATTHEW 
I can’t believe you made $15,000 in 
two weeks. 
Me either. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher with diligence searches his book bag. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I could’ve sworn I had two 8 balls 
left. Didn’t I pack ten before we 
left? 
MATTHEW 
No, you only packed eight. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you sure? 
Matthew looks around, unable to make eye contact; he brushes his nose, he blinks intermittently. 
MATTHEW 
You have to get organized Chris, 
didn’t you misplace one a few days 
ago? This is like the second time. 
Christopher rummages through his bag; flips it upside down. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
I didn’t want to say this to you, 
but I did see Jasmine going through 
some of your things the other day.

MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
I don’t know exactly what she was 
doing but it looked suspicious. 
Christopher’s phone vibrates, Jasmine’s name flashes. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
See that’s a sign. 
Christopher sends her call to voicemail. Fire in his eyes, he stares blankly, lost in his thoughts, oblivious to the next notification that flashes: “Give Joshua his meds”. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You’re right, starting today, I’m 
straightening out everything. 
Matthew pulls on Christopher’s suit. 
MATTHEW 
Starting with this trash right 
here. Please. 
What? 
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
You have money now, you can afford to give up these dusty suits. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s the only one I have. 
MATTHEW 
We are not throwing the biggest party of the entire school year with you walking in there smelling like the Good Will. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You have no clue what that even smells like. 
MATTHEW 
Shit. Chris. It smells like shit. You can’t come to the party looking like that. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I can’t come to MY own party 
MATTHEW 
Absolutely not. Stop being cheap. You can afford a little drip for YOUR party. 
68. 
68.
CHRISTOPHER 
(hesitant) 
Fine, only a few things. 
CLOTHING STORE MONTAGE: 
Matthew tries on sneakers. Christopher buys three pairs. Christopher tries on clothes. Christopher flexes in the 
mirror while Matthew cheers on. The bags grow larger while the money keeps leaving Christopher’s hand. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 
The house is filled with students, they party hard while the music blasts. Jasmine stands against the wall and texts Christopher: “Why aren’t you answering my calls?” 
Christopher walks through the door, he looks amazing, like a million dollars; fresh hair cut, small gold chain and new clothes. Heads turn as he catches the attention of almost every girl, including Caraleigh, who flocks to him. 
CARALEIGH 
Don’t you look edible. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thanks and thank you for convincing 
your friend to let us use her 
house. This means a lot. 
CARALEIGH 
Lisa, is always down for a party. 
Matthew interrupts. He squeezes in between the two, places his arm around Christopher. 
Chris. 
You again We’ve met? 
MATTHEW CARALEIGH MATTHEW CARALEIGH 
Some how you always manage to storm in at the right times. 
MATTHEW 
My apologies. Yo Chris, I need to speak to you for a minute. 
69. 
69.
Matthew pulls Christopher to the side. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
I need an 8 ball. I got these girls 
in the other room that want to go 
to Hell. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Ok, but make sure they give you 
money first. 
MATTHEW 
Of course, business first and then 
pleasure. Lots of pleasure. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Matt, don’t forget why we threw 
this party. 
Christopher hands Matthew the coke and Matthew runs off. INT. PARTY HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Christopher makes his rounds at the party and sells to all the students while the music blares. He runs into Jasmine. 
JASMINE 
Look at you superstar. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You want an autograph? 
JASMINE 
Drug dealer looks good on you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m starting to think so. 
JASMINE 
Oh ok, someone is feeling 
themselves. 
CHRISTOPHER 
There’s enough women in here to 
take care of that for me. 
JASMINE 
Ok, you can stop now. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m good at this, Jazz. 
70. 
70.
JASMINE 
Yea, just don’t make it a career. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Everyone breaks the rules, and the 
ones who don’t work for them. Why 
work hard when you can work smart? 
JASMINE 
That’s not working smar 
The crowd shouts. 
CROWD 
Hades! Hades! Hades! 
CHRISTOPHER 
That’s my call. 
Christopher gives her a high five and walks into the crowd. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
See you around. 
Christopher walks into the crowd. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - LATER 
Christopher gets pulled into the hallway by Caraleigh’s friend, LISA (20’s; party girl, DTF). Intoxicated, she shoves her tongue down his throat. 
LISA 
Let’s go have some fun... Inside of 
me. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Lead the way. 
Lisa guides Christopher down the hall and into a bedroom. 
INT. PARTY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lisa pushes him on the bed, takes off her shirt and rubs her breast. She unbuckles Christopher’s belt and begins to perform oral sex. He moans in euphoria. Caraleigh looms over the two before she interrupts. 
CARALEIGH 
Sharing is caring? 
71. 
71.
Caraleigh joins Lisa, drops to her knees, and sucks on 
Christopher’s penis. Christopher moans louder while the two devour him one after the other until he erupts. 
CARALEIGH (CONT'D) 
(To Lisa) 
I can take it from here. 
Lisa smiles, exits. Caraleigh stumbles while she stands up. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you ok? 
CARALEIGH 
I’m feeling a little too good. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I can take you home. 
CARALEIGH 
No it’s ok, I just need some water 
and a little bit of this. 
Caraleigh pulls out a small packet of Hades and snorts a line. Christopher wipes himself off and pulls his pants up. She pours another line on her hand; offers him some. 
CARALEIGH (CONT'D) 
Come on, it’ll help with round two. 
Caraleigh brushes Christopher’s penis from outside of his pants. Caraleigh leans her hand in... Christopher hesitates, he slowly leans in and sniffs a line 
He pauses for a minute, feeling the adrenaline in an instant. 
CHRISTOPHER 
We should go back to the party. 
CARALEIGH 
No round two for me? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Another time. 
CARALEIGH 
Aww, why? Scared your girlfriend 
might be looking for you? 
CHRISTOPHER 
My girlfriend. 
72.
72. 
CARALEIGH 
Cute, little black girl, with the 
curly hair. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Jazz? Na, she’s nothing, just a 
girl. I barely know her. I’m trying 
to get to know you. 
Jasmine stands in the doorway of the bedroom with her arms crossed. Her mouth drops, her eyes flood. 
JASMINE 
Wow, that’s what I am? 
Christopher turns around pale. Jasmine storms off. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Jazz, wait. I did 
Christopher buckles his pants and grabs his shirt. He runs after Jasmine into the 
HALLWAY 
He grabs her arm tight. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Jasmine, wait. Come on you know I 
didn’t mean it like that? 
JASMINE 
I think the words, she’s nothing, 
just a girl, I barely know her are 
more than clear. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I meant we’re just friends. 
JASMINE 
Are we? Because I’m not too sure 
about that anymore. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Come on Jazz 
JASMINE 
You’re right about one thing, we 
barely know each other. The 
Christopher I know, doesn’t need 
fancy ass clothes to flex and he 
damn sure doesn’t sniff coke. 
(MORE) 
(MORE) 
73.
73. 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
JASMINE (CONT'D) 
You’re way too deep in this shit 
you forgot the God damn assignment 
and the people who helped you. 
Jasmine walks off. Christopher grabs her by the arm. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I forgot the assignment? Ms. I was 
faking, I didn’t really sniff it, 
why do you think I had my back 
turned. I don’t know who you think 
you’re fooling but I know you’ve 
been stealing my 8 balls. 
What! 
JASMINE 
CHRISTOPHER 
You heard me. Matthew told me you 
were going through my stuff. 
JASMINE 
First of all, I didn’t go through 
anything. Second, Matthew, the red 
nose dip shit, who’s always 
sweating and on 1000, told you 
this? I don’t even recognize you 
anymore. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I haven’t done anything but get 
fucked and do a little bit of coke. 
Isn’t that the same shit you came 
to my room for? 
Jasmine pushes Christopher he falls against the wall. 
JASMINE 
Fuck you Christopher! I can’t 
believe you would say some shit 
like that to me. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Fuck you too, Bitch! Go find 
someone else’s shit to steal. 
Jasmine storms off. Christopher walks toward the kitchen; pours himself a drink. He jumps up and down to the music and joins the crowd. 
74. 
74.
INT. PARTY HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Caraleigh barges into the bathroom and finds Matthew on the toilet sniffing a line of coke. She cracks a smile and falls on the floor; breathes hard. Matthew looks at her and smiles. 
MATTHEW 
This is a great fucking party. 
CARALEIGH 
(muffled)) 
You should start your own promotion 
company. 
MATTHEW 
Are you ok? 
CARALEIGH 
I just need a second... To breathe. 
Matthew empties a line of coke on his hand. His sits next to Caraleigh and extends his hand in front of her face. 
MATTHEW 
Here, this will help. 
Caraleigh leans in, her head drops on his hand and her body goes limp. She collapses on the floor. Matthew jumps up in terror, his face flushed as he stares at Caraleigh while she spasms on the floor, her face glistens with sweat, foams protrudes from her mouth. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Oh shit. Oh shit. 
Matthew stands immobile, eyes wide absolutely terrified, he has no clue what to do. He rushes toward her when her body falls stiff. He halts. Matthew glares at her dormant body. With trepidation, Matthew extends a gentle kick to her body. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Hey, hey, get up. Get up. 
Matthew freaks out. He paces back and forth. 
MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Oh shit. What the fuck? 
In a panic, Matthew grabs a wash cloth and wipes his finger prints from the toilet seat, and around the bathroom, he wipes down the knob, locks it again and exits with haste. 
75. 
75.
EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Matthew’s heart beats hard and loud; he rushes through the crowd and searches each room, for Christopher like a mad man. 
MATTHEW 
Hey, have you seen Chris? 
He runs down the 
HALLWAY 
And rushes on to the 
LAWN 
MATTHEW 
Has anyone seen my friend, 
Christopher? Christopher! 
Lisa hugs Matthew from behind. 
LISA 
I just saw him leave. 
Chris? 
MATTHEW LISA 
No, Elmo... Yes, silly. 
Matthew pushes Lisa off; rushes out of the house. He trips over the steps before he jumps into his car and speeds off. 
INT. CHRISTOPHER'S DORM ROOM - NEXT DAY 
Christopher’s phone vibrates loud on the night stand. Hungover, he moves slow while his head throbs. He lays down and closes his eyes. His phone rings again. Matthew is passed out on the next bed, he snores loud. 
Christopher looks at his phone: “27 missed calls from Aunt Nancy,” before he can call her back a text message flashes: “Turn on the news”. Christopher unable to get up reaches for the remote on the night stand and turns on the TV. 
76.

Grant, witnesses say she was at a 
party in the area of Hasenburry 
when authorities found her 
unresponsive in the bathroom. No 
arrest have been made in connection 
to her death. 
Christopher sits on the bed paralyzed and glued to the TV. He falls on to the bed and breathes deep. A tear falls, he swipes his hands over his face, gets up, kicks Matthew’s bed. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Wake up Matt, Matt wake up! 
Matthew moves slow and groggy. Christopher sits immobile. He stares at the TV and his eyes flood. 
MATTHEW 
I’m up. What happened? 
A bang at the door startles Christopher. He looks around. 
Who is it? 
CHRISTOPHER 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.)

Christopher opens the door to Joshua and Aunt Nancy.

Aunt Nancy opens the door and slams it behind her.

Joshua pulls out a drawing from his bag. 
JOSHUA 
I made this for you. This is me and 
this is you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
My head is not that big. 
Joshua chuckles. Christopher’s cell phone rings. He looks at the phone in his hand- it’s not ringing. Matthew gets up from his bed, drinking a bottle of water. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Matt, answer your phone. 
78. 
78.
The phone keeps ringing. 
MATTHEW 
It’s not mine. 
Christopher panics while he searches for the phone Donir gave him. Christopher leaps over the bag and falls on the floor, he grabs his jeans, pulls out the phone and answers. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Hello? Hello?... What? Right now? 
But I haven 
The phone hangs up, Christopher examines the screen. 
Shit! 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) MATTHEW

MATTHEW 
It’s ok, it’s fine. Little Brother

video games or something until you 
get back. Right? 
Joshua smiles. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Are you sure? 
MATTHEW 
I got it, don’t worry. 
Matthew passes Joshua a game controller. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’ll be right back. 
With haste, Christopher packs his yellow book bag of coke and puts it in his secret spot. He grabs the bag of money and heads out. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Call me if you need anything. 
MATTHEW 
We’re good. Don’t worry. 
79.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The black bag is ripped off of Christopher’s head. Big C sits behind his desk drinking Cognac. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I thought you said I didn’t need 
the bag over my head anymore? 
BIG C 
You have something for me? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I didn’t get to finish selling all 
of it. 
BIG C 
That’s your problem. 
Christopher reaches in the bag and passes him the money. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
I’ll be in touch. 
CHRISTOPHER 
You’re not going to give me another 
one? 
BIG C 
I want you to lay low for a minute.

Big C stares at Christopher.

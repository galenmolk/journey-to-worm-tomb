INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 
CAST VERSION 
CHRISTOPHER PRINCE (18; a preppy and studious intellect) JUMPS in a panic, from his tattered twin size bed when the sounds of GUN SHOTS blare through his bedroom window. 
NEIGHBOR (O.S.) 
Come on yo, it’s too early in da 
mornin fa dis fuckin shit. 
His heart POUNDS, he wipes the crust from his eyes and rests his face in his hands. Aggravated, Christopher drops his head back on the pillow. He exhales deep and stares at the filthy pop corn ceiling. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Thank you God, for getting me out 
of this place. 
His thoughts are interrupted by Christopher’s little brother, JOSHUA PRINCE (6; undeniably adorable and needy). Joshua stands at the end of the bed, he grabs Christopher’s toes. Christopher picks his brother up and holds him tight. 
JOSHUA 
The fire crackers woke me up again. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I’m sorry, Joshua. 
JOSHUA 
(rubs his eyes) 
I’m hungry. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Guess what? I’m hungry too. 
Christopher grabs Joshua, throws him on the bed. He tickles Joshua while they both laugh hysterical. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I’m going to eat you for breakfast. 
Christopher hugs Joshua tight and looks him in the eyes. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Do you know what today is? 
Joshua drops his head unable to make eye contact. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
You’re going to be a big boy for 
Aunt Nancy until I get back right?

JOSHUA 
CAST VERSION 
Can I go with you? 
CHRISTOPHER 
Not this time, Buddy. I promise you 
once I get settled, I’m coming 
right back for you. 
JOSHUA 
Is Mommy going to be there? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(doleful) 
No, she will not. Remember we spoke 
about this? It’s just us. Do you 
understand what I’m saying? 
Joshua nods. Christopher points to Joshua’s chest. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
And Mommy will be right here. 
Always and forever... 
The two perform their brotherly handshake. YOU...ME...WE. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Let’s get you some food. 
Christopher gets up from the bed and stretches, he grabs a towel from a nearby chair and wraps it around his neck when-- a roach crawls across his chest. Christopher freaks out; he swipes the roach and wiggles his body. Joshua laughs loud. 
INT. PROJECT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The pair walk down the hall when another set of CHILDREN run by them. They reach the kitchen where AUNT NANCY (40; a money hungry foster guardian) irons clothes and talks on the phone. 
AUNT NANCY 
Good mornin’ to you too. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(rolls his eyes) 
Would you give us a chance to get 
in the kitchen? 
Aunt Nancy SLAMS the iron down, she glares at Christopher. 
AUNT NANCY

Good Morning, Aunt Nancy.

Aunt Nancy points the steaming iron toward Christopher. 
AUNT NANCY 
Don’t Forget who took care of your 
ass these past years. 
(on the phone) 
Just like his damn mother. Anyway, 
what time you gonna be ready? I 
gotta get away from all dese kids. 
Christopher walks to the cupboard. He grabs Joshua’s bottles of prescriptions; pours the pills into his hands. He grabs a cup and fills it with tap water from the kitchen sink. 
Christopher passes Joshua his meds and the water. Joshua swallows all of the contents and smiles wide with pride. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Great job, Josh. 
Christopher grabs two bowls from the cupboard and a box of cereal from the top of the fridge. He pours cereal in the bowls, goes back to the fridge, grabs the milk. 
He empties the milk into Joshua’s bowl- there’s barely enough for a sufficient bowl of cereal. Christopher shakes his head frustrated. Sadness clouds Joshua’s face. 
JOSHUA 
We can share. 
CHRISTOPHER 
It’s fine, you need all of this 
food for those big muscles. Let me 
see how big they are? 
Joshua flexes his arm. Christopher’s eyes widen he leans in. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
Man! I need to start going to your 
gym class. 
Joshua eats his food. Christopher walks toward the bathroom.

TRAE 
Aight, dats enough.

Trae pulls out a knot of money from his pockets. Christopher and Matthew look on memorized; their eyes sparkle. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
I get mines tax free and witout dat 
frail ass piece of paper. Why work 
hard when you can work smart? 
An all black matte Range Rover with dark tints pulls behind Matthew’s car. The windows roll down partially exposing another MAN in the backseat. Christoper gets a quick glance. 
TRAE (CONT'D) 
Have fun in school, Einstein. Lemme

That’s my friend, Jasmine. 
MATTHEW 
Hook a nigga up?

CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
My bad, I didn’t mean it like that. 
Don’t get all February on me. 
Christopher looks around terrified. He jumps in Matthew’s face and whispers in an angry and fearful tone. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Surviving Brooklyn for five minutes 
does not grant you a black card. 
MATTHEW 
Ok, Bro. Relax... Hook a Cracker 
up. Better?

Getting there. 
They both stare at Jasmine in awe as she heads toward them.

CHRISTOPHER MATTHEW 
Bro, on my drive over here. I saw a big ass rat.

Hey, I’m Christopher Prince. 
CARALEIGH 
You’re Ms. Rachel’s son, right? I 
just finished an internship with 
your mother’s old firm. So sorry

We haven’t received any form of 
payment, Hun. 
CHRISTOPHER 
How is that possible? 
WANDA 
The one and only payment I have

If your expenses are being

withdrawn from your trust it 
shouldn’t take long for the payment 
to process. 
Wanda looks concerned, she places her hand over Christopher’s and passes him a business card. 
WANDA (CONT'D) 
I’ll put your account on hold in 
the mean time. Don’t worry, you 
have a month to complete your 
payment that’s plenty of time to 
get your situation settled. 
Thank you. 
CHRISTOPHER 
He takes the card and exits with fire in his eyes. He pulls out his phone and dials, Aunt Nancy. The phone goes straight to voicemail. Christopher hangs up and sends a text. 
CHRISTOPHER (TEXT) (CONT'D) 
Call me back please, my school

Christopher hangs up his phone and bangs it on his head. 
INT. VISTA BANK - OFFICE - LATER 
Christopher sits at the desk across from his interviewer, DONALD HILDEBRAND (40’s; President of Vista Bank, immature as if he’s having a mid-life crisis). 
DONALD 
Young man, your resume is 
impressive. Impeccable references 
and my personal favorite, Captain 
of the Chess team, you’ll have to 
teach me how to play someday. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Chess is very much like the game of

CHRISTOPHER 
Will do. Thank you so much. 
DONALD 
Anytime. I’ll have my Assistant 
send you the paperwork, we’ll start 
you at nineteen dollars an hour. 
CHRISTOPHER

Don’t look so excited, you’ve only beat 2,400 other applicants that applied for the position. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Because he knew my mom. 
Who cares? 
MATTHEW 
CHRISTOPHER 
It only pays up to 3% of the next

like yesterday and my Aunt isn’t 
answering any of my calls. 
A notification flashes across Christopher’s phone: “Give Joshua his meds”. Christopher huffs. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
May I borrow your phone? 
Matthew hands Christopher his phone. Christopher dials Aunt Nancy’s number. The phone rings for half a second. 
Hello? 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.) CHRISTOPHER 
Aunt Nancy, It’s me, Christopher. Did Joshua take his meds? 
AUNT NANCY (O.S.) 
Yes. Whatchu want? I’m busy. 
CHRISTOPHER 
My school never received my tuition payment. I called the attorney he said my trust was exhausted. 
AUNT NANCY 
Ok?! I ain’t got no money. So you called the wrong one.

17. 
CHRISTOPHER 
CAST VERSION 
Aunt Nancy, I need that money to 
pay for my tuition. 
AUNT NANCY 
You a smart boy, go get you one of 
dem scholarship things. 
Christopher’s body tenses up; he closes his eyes, breathes deep. Unable to hold back, his fist clench, the anger bursts. 
CHRISTOPHER 
What happened to all my funds?! 
AUNT NANCY 
Watch ya damn tone! You think da 
roof ova ya head and food you eat 
is free? I took care of you dese

CHRISTOPHER 
I want my money!

AUNT NANCY 
Aunt Nancy hangs up the phone. Christopher hands Matthew his phone. He rests his head; he can’t fight the tears that fall. Matthew sits in silence, he passes Christopher a tissue. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know what I’m going to do. 
MATTHEW 
We’ll figure something out. I got 
your back. Whatever you need. 
Christopher sits motionless while his eyes stay glued to the Man he saw earlier in the truck, Big C (40’s; a react first menace). Big C exits the bank and climbs into the same SUV.

MATTHEW (CONT'D) 
Shit, I can’t see them now. 
Christopher looks on eager, the SUV turns into the right lane and makes an exit. 
CHRISTOPHER 
They’re right there, hurry up, take 
the exit. 
Matthew switches lanes, cuts off the car beside him and almost causes an accident. He merges on to the exit. His car screeches from the speed while he tries to catch up. 
The SUV drives down the street and makes a left turn into an alley. Big C steps out of the car. Hurried, Matthew turns into the alley. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
No! Don’t turn, don’t turn! 
MATTHEW 
What the hell? 
Matthew turns in the opposite direction, his car screeches, rolls off the curb and jumps off the side walk. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Drive, drive! 
Matthew pushes hard on the gas, his heart races.

MATTHEW 
What kind of suicide squad mission did you have me on? Why were we following that man? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I don’t know. I had this feeling. 
MATTHEW 
Are you crazy? I may not be street smart but even I know you don’t go around following drug dealers.

(mocking) 
I have this feeling. 
Christopher sits down; pushes his hands against his face. He looks up and is instantly punched in the face by DONIR (40’s; Big C’s, oversized body guard). Christopher falls back into the car, he hits his head on the steering wheel. 
He is dragged out and thrown into a black SUV. A black bag is forced over his head and the SUV speeds off. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The bag is ripped from Christopher’s head where he kneels directly across from Big C. Christopher’s mouth drips blood; he holds his jaw in pain and his heart races with fear. Big C glowers at Christopher. 
BIG C 
What’s ya name? 
Terrified, Christopher is unable to speak. 
BIG C (CONT'D) 
I’m not going to ask you again. 
My name.

BIG C (CONT'D) 
Are you a good boy? 
Yes, sir. 
CHRISTOPHER BIG C 
Did you plan on dying today? 
No, sir. 
CHRISTOPHER BIG C 
You better have a good reason for 
following me? 
Christopher stares at Big C mute. Big C unlocks the gun. 
CHRISTOPHER 
I, I need a job. 
Christopher pulls the backpack off his back, he reaches into his bag slow and steady. He pulls out his resume. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I really need a job, Sir. 
He passes Big C his resume. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) 
I graduated high school 
Valedictorian. I was President of

BIG C (CONT'D) 
Do I look like I need an Assistant? 
22.

CHRISTOPHER 
CAST VERSION 
I’m not asking for an 
administrative role, Sir. I’m 
looking for a sales job. 
BIG C 
(laughs louder) 
You don’t have the qualifications 
for that kind of position. 
CHRISTOPHER 
When I was in high school I sold 
answers to our regents exams. 
BIG C 
Aren’t you the Juvenile? 
CHRISTOPHER 
I sold my lunch snacks for twice 
the amount the Cafeteria sold them 
BIG C 
This isn’t high school, these 
streets are real life, it’s not a 
fucking game. 
CHRISTOPHER 
Respectfully, Sir, the streets are 
not my clientele. Think about 
College like the current appraisal 
gap between black and white

They fell for it though, they loved

CHRISTOPHER 
Why did you do that?! We were only 
suppose to go and scope out the 
place, nothing more! 
JASMINE 
Why are you screaming at me, I was 
helping you? 
CHRISTOPHER 
(breathes deep) 
I’m sorry... It was there, Jazz, 
plenty of opportunity. I just, felt

CHRISTOPHER 
Donnie, I have something way better

Cerberus is Hades’ dog, he guards 
the gates of the Underworld to 
prevent the dead from leaving. 
CHRISTOPHER 
These are amazing. You drew this?

I meant we’re just friends. 
JASMINE 
Are we? Because I’m not too sure

Jasmine pushes Christopher he falls against the wall. 
JASMINE

like that to me.
